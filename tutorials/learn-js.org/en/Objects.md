Tutorial
--------

JavaScript is a functional language, and for object oriented programming it uses both objects and functions, but objects are usually used as a data structure, similar to a dictionary in Python or a map in Java. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use objects as a data structure. The advanced tutorials explain more about object oriented JavaScript.

To initialize an object, use curly braces:

    var emptyObject = {};
    var personObject = {
        firstName : "John",
        lastName : "Smith"
    }

### Member addressing

Members of objects can be addressed using the brackets operator `[]`, very much like arrays, but just like many
other object oriented languages, the period `.` operator can also be used. They are very similar, except for
the fact that brackets return a member by using a string, in contrast to the period operator,
which requires the member to be a simple word (the word should not contain spaces, 
start with a number or use illegal characters).

For example, we can continue to fill the person object with more details:

    var personObject = {
        firstName : "John",
        lastName : "Smith"
    }
    personObject.age = 23;
    personObject["salary"] = 14000;

### Iteration

Iterating over members of a dictionary is not a trivial task, since iterating over objects can also yield members who don't actually belong to an object. Therefore, we must use the `hasOwnProperty` method to check that the member in fact belongs to the object.

    for (var member in personObject)
    {
        if (personObject.hasOwnProperty(member))
        {
            console.log("the member " + member + " of personObject is " + personObject[member])
        }
    }

This will eventually print out

    the member firstName of personObject is John
    the member lastName of personObject is Smith
    the member age of personObject is 23
    the member salary of personObject is 14000

Note that methods of objects in JavaScript have a fixed order, like arrays.

Exercise
--------

You must define an object called `person` with the following members:

1. The member `firstName` of the person is "Jack"
2. The member `lastName` of the person is "Smith"
3. The member `age` of the person is 19
4. The member `employed` of the person is `true`

Tutorial Code
-------------

// TODO: change this code
var person;

console.log(person.firstName);
console.log(person.lastName);
console.log(person.age);
console.log(person.employed);

Expected Output
---------------

Jack
Smith
19
true

Solution
--------

// TODO: change this code
var person = {
    firstName : "Jack",
    lastName : "Smith",
    age : 19,
    employed : true
}

console.log(person.firstName);
console.log(person.lastName);
console.log(person.age);
console.log(person.employed);

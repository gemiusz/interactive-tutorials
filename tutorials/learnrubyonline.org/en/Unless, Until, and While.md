Tutorial
--------
The `unless` statement is structured similarly to an `if` statement.

    unless condition
      #thing to be done if the condition is false
    end

It is basically the reverse of the if statement, because `if` statements will only be done if the condition is `true`, but the `unless` statement will only be done if the condition is `false`. The `else` keyword can also be used inside `unless` statements. 

`while` statements repeat a block of code as long as a condition is `true`.

    while condition
        #something to do
    end

`until` statements are the opposite of `while` statements; they repeat until a condition becomes `true`. Here is their syntax:

    until condition
        #something to do
    end

###Important!

Make sure that you don't make an **infinite loop**. An infinite loop repeats forever, stopping your program from ever advancing, because the condition never changes to what will stop the loop.
Exercise

--------
Make a while or until statement from scratch that will `puts` "I'm looping!" to the console 7 times.

Tutorial Code
-------------
   #Make your loop below!

Expected Output
---------------
I'm looping!
I'm looping!
I'm looping!
I'm looping!
I'm looping!
I'm looping!
I'm looping!

Solution
--------
   #Make your loop below!
condition = 0
while condition<=6
    puts "I'm looping!"
    condition = condition + 1
end

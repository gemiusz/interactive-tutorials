# Welcome

Welcome to the learnRust.org free interactive Rust tutorial.

this website is intended for learning Rust from scratch with zero knowldge on it. It's expected however that you know the basic programing concept in any other language in order to follow the tutorials.

There is no need to download anything - Just click on the chapter you wish to begin from, and follow the instructions. Good luck!

### Introduction
Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine, and the Rust compiler. The compiler is free and open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0. 

Rust is a system programming language that is safe and concurrent. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but provides memory safety without using garbage collection.

Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016

Rust is fit for:

* building powerful web applications
* embedded systems programming
* building distributed online services
* cross-platform command line support

Major companies using Rust:

* Dropbox
* Atlassian
* Amazon AWS

A variable is a named piece of data. You can use a variable to store a value within your program, and refer to it later by the variable name. 

Variables are defined using `=`:

    myFirstVariable = "I made a variable!"

Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then refer back to it:

    puts myFirstVariable

There are three main types of variable:

- Strings (a collection of symbols inside speech marks)
- Booleans (true or false)
- Numbers (numeric values)

    aString = "I'm a string!"
    aBoolean = true
    aNumber = 42

Tutorial

A string is a collection of characters/symbols inside quotation marks. Strings are interpreted by the computer as raw text.

You can use single quotes or double quotes for strings - either one is acceptable.

    myFirstString = 'I am a string!' #single quotes
    mySecondString = "Me too!" #double quotes

There are many built-in methods in Ruby for manipulating strings. 

`.length` will give you the number of characters in a string.

    "Hi!".length #is 3

`.reverse` will flip the string around.

    "Hi!".reverse #is !iH

`.upcase` will make a string all caps.

    "Hi!".upcase #is HI!

and `.downcase` will make a string all lowercase.

    "Hi!".downcase #is hi!

You can also use many methods at once. They are solved from left to right.

    "Hi!".downcase.reverse #is !ih

If you want to check if one string contains another string, you can use `.include?`.

    "Happy Birthday!".include?("Happy")

The above code evaluates to `true`.

Exercise
--------
Take the given string and use methods to make the code print out "!edoc ma i !ih".

Tutorial Code
-------------

myString = "Hi! I am code!" #In the next line, use methods to change it.
myNewString = myString
puts myNewString

Expected Output
---------------

!edoc ma i !ih

Solution
--------

myString = "Hi! I am code!" #In the next lines, use methods to change it.
myNewString = myString.reverse.downcase
puts myNewString
